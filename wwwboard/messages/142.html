Possibly a very naive, uneducated question, but....<p>I've heard it said that space is one dimension, not 3.  The 3-D model comes from an arbitrary division of this dimension into subdimensions.  It raises the question of what defines a dimension, and what rules govern dimensions (and come to that, whether the same rules apply to all dimensions).<p>Is this 2-d model a fair description of the spacetime, or is it just a device to help visualise it as a plane?  And what implications does this have?<p>Anyone who can shed any light - it'd be appreciated
