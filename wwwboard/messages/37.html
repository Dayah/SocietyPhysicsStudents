Dr. Kamyshkov is interested in designing an experiment to try to detect neutron to anti-neutron oscillations.  I have talked with him, and the project is very interesting.  If anyone plans on doing experimental physics, this would be a great opportunity for you.  It has the potential to open up new areas of physics.  If you're interested, email Dr. Kamyshkov at kamyshov@utk.edu
