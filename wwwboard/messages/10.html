Hey guys.  This past meeting we had Dr. Elston give a presentation going more in depth into our cosmic ray project.  We went over a plan on how we plan to begin the project though we still don't have any concrete details yet.  He also went over the construction of a detector (parts, equipment, data, etc.).  For more information on that stuff go to http:/csr.phys.ualberta.ca/nalta or search Google for NALTA.  We also decided on some things for decorating our lounge.  We plan on painting the walls 'Huckleberry' Blue. I'm not sure what kind of shade that is (i didnt pick it and dont know how it got picked, but let's hope it will look good :).  We also decided to carpet the main area and get nice, fluffy pillows for the couches.  (Make that extra fluffy :)  We are going to try and move the boxes of books and any other obstacles lying in the floor in that small storage closet temporarily.  There's talk of getting a microwave, but i dont know what we decided on that.  Also I think there's a movement going to clean up the kitchen also, which sounds like a cool idea to me.  I think that's it for now.  Stay tuned for more updates and make the meetings when possible for more detailed info.  Have a good weekend!
