: i came across this book on the theory of everything. it clams to have discovered it. is this for real i don’t know enough about physics to discredit him because i am only in h.s. and haven’t gained enough knowledge. i was wondering if any one could bounce a few ideas back at me, some good iedas and bad ideas about the short book on line hear is the link http://www.pabird.supanet.com/~pabird/book/#Introduction check it out<p>I stopped reading after I saw, "Before you get any ideas, let me tell you that you will not learn anything remotely useful by reading this book. Knowing the secret to the universe will not get you off work in the morning, it will not make your cornflakes taste any better..."<p>He admits his theory makes no predictions and offers no testable hypotheses. In other words, it lies totally outside the realm of science.
