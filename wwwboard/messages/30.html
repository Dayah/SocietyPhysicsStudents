Again, possible. The problem with orbits is that they decay because space isn't a perfect vacuum. All orbiting bodies lose their energy to particles they hit in space. With planets very close together, there's not much room to decay. When you introduce atmosphere, which creates so much friction our launched satellites regularly fall to earth and require thrusters, the decay becomes a much greater problem, especially at the close distances you describe.<p>It sounds like you're more interested in multiple planet systems. It's very difficult to get more than two bodies to orbit each other. Two bodies generally represent stable equilibrium. If the orbit decays or some other perturbation is introduced, they'll probably continue to orbit each other. Multiple bodies generally represent unstable equilibrium. You <em>can</em> find positions and trajectories that'll allow multiple planets to all orbit each other indefinitely, but if something is slightly nudged, a body may be ejected or fall into another. There's some complex mathematics behind this that I don't fully understand. To really get a feel for this stable and unstable equilibrium yourself, I strongly suggest you <a href="http://www.dayah.com/software/gravity.exe">download this small gravity simulation program</a>. It's from the early '90s and for Windows 3.1, but it works on XP. After a little fooling around, you should be able to master making binary stars orbit each other. If you're able to get 3 stars to orbit each other for more than half a dozen cycles, save the simulation and send it to me, because I can't. The chances are very low that something will randomly occur if we have trouble making it work in a simple program with a goal in mind, not to mention the decay problem that this program doesn't take into account.
