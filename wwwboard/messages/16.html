We the students of the Electronics Lab in order to form a more coherent SPS schedule do propose this:<br>1) Move the meeting day as previously discussed to Thursdays after 3:30.<br>2) Extend the time of the coffee and donuts by an hour or 2 (8-12). The donuts don't have to come in that early, but it would be great to meet earlier since a lot of us have classes during this time.<br>3) The photos of the students in the club. The members photos page only has a couple. Maybe we could take more photos to include the rest of the club and not just a few from the Modern Physics class.<br>4) Joey is God. Bow down to Him. He knoweth everything and one day might tell you all about it. He will tell you how he discovered element 116!!<br>5) Kipp is my arch nemesis. He must be stopped. Do not ask him about "purty mouth" syndrome.<br>6) Update on the revolution: Sinister Sarah  (help me) is subverting the entire UT system so that only her Matlab program will run! <br>7) Denise is planning on taking down Sinister Sarah since her Matlab program for Mechanics will not work!
