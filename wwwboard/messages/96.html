<p>Here is a great software program I've been using to story board my screenplay to beef up my script submission packages to studios and production companys. It's been super easy to use...very short learning curve...and the finished storyboards look pretty darn cool. I would recommend it to anyone who wanted to take the extra step with their movie script. I'm sure it would be great for commercial projects too. <p>http://www.powerproduction.com<br>http://www.storyboardartist.com<br>
