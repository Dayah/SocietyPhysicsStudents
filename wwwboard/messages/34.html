The speed of light and the speed of sight are not exactly the same thing, what we percieve as sight is really what our brains interpret. How long it takes for us to see an object really depends on how fast our brain can process the information it recieves. Also the speed of light on the earth can be affected by various things. Those affects might be so minute that most people would now consider them a factor in computing the speed of light. <p>Time is relative also, meaning that if we live in a 10 dimensional universe instead of 4 we would percieve time in a completly different concept that we do now. The main reason why we percieve time as in past, present, and future is because that is the best way that our minds can preceive it. Imagine the headache we would have seeing all 3 phases of time at one time.<p>To the part that if we were to see faster than the speed of light would the hands on the clock appear to move backwards, I am not sure on that. I know that the closer that you are at the speed of light the slower the hands on the clock will appear.<p>Hope this helps and please excuse any errors that I may make.
