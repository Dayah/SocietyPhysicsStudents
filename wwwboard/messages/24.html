I really don't want to believe that gravity exists.  Why?  Well, In World History, we are watching the 100 most infuential people of the millenium past.  #2 is Newton.  I plan on tearing A&E's bang-up list to shreds online once I get some time.  I would really like to hear some theories on other ways to explain what happens.  Here are one's I've heard before:<p><br>*The bowling ball on the matress, throw marbles in random spots around the matress.  From above it looks as if the marbles are going towards the ball, but from a different perspective, it is revealed to be something else.  I'm not sure what that something else is (gravity itself?), so if anyone understands that, let me know.<p><br>*When we jump, the ground and we grow at a rate and we catch up to each other.  I don't buy this one because I would be crushed within minutes of going in a room because of the rate at which everything grows, unless I misinterpreted it.<p>That's it.  If you have any explanations for those or other than those, please let me know.  I don't want to hear about how thousands of experements supporting the existance of gravity prove it, just please e-mail me with any thoughts.  Or just post on this thread.  jzeichman@tc3net.com<p>
