Hello, nice of you to read my book. Did you enjoy it? I wrote it about a year ago, and haven't really updated it since. Maybe I will this year if I have time. Some of it, is a bit out of date with my current thinking, especially the bits about gravity which I may add a chapter on. Some of my slightly more recent thoughts are at www.pabird.supanet.com/theory if you're interested. My interests have more moved over to film production at the moment though ( www.filmclubuk.com ). :)
