I was pondering an idea that recently came to me. Would it be at all conceiveable for several small "planets" (smaller or equal in mass to our moon) to orbit around eachother with no large parent planet. For example and clarification, two or more planets with an unprecedented similarity in mass, orbiting around each other. Assuming the preceding is possible, is it at all pheasable that if this grouping or clumping of planets (if there were quite a large number--ten or more)could in affect share atmospheres?<p>This will most likely seem hugely imaginative, but I would be interested in anyone's take on this odd question.
