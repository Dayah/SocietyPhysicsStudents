Just wanted everyone to know what happened at the last meeting. We had Dr.Efremenko give a talk about cosmic rays and various types of detectors. It was very informative, and it gave us many ideas on what to do about building our own detector. After that, we discussed remodeling the undergraduate lounge. Painting, drinks, and other aspects of the room were the subjects. Lastly, we talked about homecoming. We talked about some of the displays we planned on showing. We will be meeting in room 201 at 9 a.m. on that Saturday, so if you are interested in helping, contact Olga. Until next week...
