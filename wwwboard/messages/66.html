Peter Lynds is correct.  First and foremost, time is a conception of intelligence, used to measure distance, velocity and our own mortality.  To the rock hurtling through space-there is no time.  Time can not be split or whittled down to an 'instant' where an objects position (moving through that instant) can be determined.  By its very definition an instant in time is a measurement, and if it can be measured then it can not be an 'instant' as conceptualized by most.  The same can be said for matter.  If the smallest particle known were split would not the two resulting pieces be even smaller?  Time works the same way, and with out revamping or current thinking in physics (time and matter are fluid and infinite) humans will never have a good understanding of our universe.<p>
