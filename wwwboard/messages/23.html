<br> Your right and another thing that tipped me off later in to book is when it says that it may take the supercomputers of the future months and even years to get any predictions at all “but this doesn’t mean that there is anything wrong with the theory.” He seems like he’s in denial, but I wanted to make sure because I don’t know enough to judge a person who seems to know want he is talking about. Thank you vary much for the insight.  <br>
