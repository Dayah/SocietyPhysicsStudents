I hope this is the proper forum for my question. I do not have a science background but have an interest in it. My question is compound and somewhat complex. I hope I am able to make myself clear. First, is the speed of light the same as the speed of sight (for instance: the speed of sight would be equal to the time it takes for a person to open his eyes and see a clock)? If the statement above is true, couldn't one theorize that if light and sight are the same then time is equal to the speed of light/sight? If it is the same (assume that it is for the sake of answering this question), wouldn't a person or matter that traveled faster than light/sight actually go backwards in time because it is moving faster than time? Theoretically, if one was able to look at a clock faster than light/sight wouldn't the hands on the clock appear to be moving backwards? Could you let me know if this makes any sense to you?<br>Thanks.<p><br>
