: Hi,

: I'm currently studying the &lt;I&gt;extended &lt;B&gt;electricity & magnetism&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt; course in the university, and I've found no sites with &lt;B&gt;relatively difficult&lt;/B&gt; questions and their detailed &lt;B&gt;solutions&lt;/B&gt;.

: &lt;B&gt;I would be more than greatful&lt;/B&gt; for any &lt;B&gt;link, suggestion, name of a book&lt;/B&gt;, etc. you would provide. I also think that the more links will be suggested here the more this thread will help others who are searching for the same thing.

: By &lt;I&gt;&quot;relatively difficult&quot;&lt;/I&gt; I mean that to solve the problem one has to try a &lt;B&gt;non trivial approach&lt;/B&gt; to the problem (not merely using a formula, but showing a deeper understanding).

: -----------------------------------------------------------

: &lt;B&gt;F O R  I N S T A N C E:&lt;/B&gt;

: 1. &lt;B&gt;Trivial:&lt;/B&gt;
: An electron is accelerated across a potential difference of 240 V. Calculate the resulting change in potential energy.

: 2. &lt;B&gt;Easy:&lt;/B&gt;
: Calculate the minimum electric field strength required to stop a proton travelling at 0.01% the speed of light in the space of 2 cm.

: 3. &lt;B&gt;Relatively difficult:&lt;/B&gt;
: In an infinite vaccuum space there is an object of an unknown form, which is charged with an equal space density Ro. An empty spherical space of radius R is made inside the object such that the sphere's center is positioned at some point O (all the spherical space is inside the object). Given that before the creation of the space the potential in point O is Phi0, what will be the potential in O after it's creation?

: 4. &lt;B&gt;Relatively difficult:&lt;/B&gt;
: A circular ring of radius R is centered at the origin (O=(0,0). An arc of 36 degrees is charged with length-density Lamda=|Phi|*Lamda0. The rest of the ring is not charged.
: The x axis passes (in the positive direction from the origin O) through the middle of the charged arc.
: Calculate the potential at a given point D from the origin O (D&gt;R).
: Hint: you can use the fact that the integration will pass only through small angles.

: -----------------------------------------------------------

: &lt;B&gt;Thanks in advance!&lt;/B&gt;
