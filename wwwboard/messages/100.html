Hi Folks,<p>It seems that due to a technical glitch our survey was down for a couple of days. It's up and running again so if you have a few minutes, please give it a look! <p>I apologize for any of you who have tried to take it and received an error message. If this is the case and you have time to take it again, just note "try 2" after your name in the name field and we will give you two entries in our raffle as a thank you for your patience.<p>Thanks again for all of your help.<p>Jennifer Borse <br>
