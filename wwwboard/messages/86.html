He's not a hoax. I hate to disappoint you, but it seems that not only has Lynds' paper been published in Foundations of Physics, but its drawn support from a number of highly respected physicists. Murray Gell-mann seems to be one of the latest. His work is also already being covered in class at my university. I've read 2 of his papers and they both seem right on.<p>Saying that you studied physics for 7 years doesn't mean much. If you added the number of years that the people that linds' ideas contradict spent studying physics, mathematics or philosophy, it would probably be in the many thousands. I've spent 6 years studying physics (and math), but I don't think one requires such a background to get a grasp of his basic arguments and conclusions or to see their worth. I can only assume that you're a little close minded and also probably a tad jealous. <p>T
