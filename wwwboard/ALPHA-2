This is WWWBoard Version 2.0 ALPHA 2

Te name was changed from WebBoard, because I found out O'Reilly has a 
copyright on that name.  Ooops!

That means that there are obviously going to be problems with it.. That's why 
its ALPHA.  If you find something you think is an error, or think of an option 
you would like added, please mail me at:
